# Open Data Science Questions

## Problem
Given a binary classifier that leverages sample weights to accentuate stronger positives, 
1. What are the best evaluation metrics and why? Show your work. Also, please include a clear explaination how each stated metric works. 
2. Write a custom evaluation metric that improves on one of these listed above - one that progressively penalizes incorrectly-predicted positives (i.e. the classifier predicted 0 when the true value is 1)
3. Build on this to now progressively reward correctly-predicted positives.

## Must use
* The given datasets in the _sample-data/_ directory
* Python
* XGBoost

## Deliverables:
Please present a Jupyter Notebook with your findings and explanations, as well as be willing to discuss in person.
